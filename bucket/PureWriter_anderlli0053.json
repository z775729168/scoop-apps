Although this problem has been fixed, I am not completely sure if some scenes may trigger this again. But don't worry, because Pure Writer for Android supports multiple Backups. You can recover/restore it by using 'History' or 'Undo'. More about automatic backup and cloud backup: https://writer.drakeet.com/backups"
