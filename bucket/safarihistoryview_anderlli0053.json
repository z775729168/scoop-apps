Every browsing history line includes the following information: URL, Web Page Title, Last Visit Time, Visit Count, Redirected To URL, and Record Index. SafariHistoryView allows you to easily export the browsing history data into text/csv/html/xml file, or copy the data to the clipboard and then paste it into Excel.",
